React.js Starter Project
========================

This is just a simple starter project that uses Gulp as a buildtool, with many build-related friends.

To get up and running, clone the project, and run

    npm install
    gulp

This will kick off BrowserSync, and if everything is working properly, you should be able to head on over to [](http://localhost:3000) and see your app up-and-running, responding happily to your changes!

**NOTE:** If you create a new javascript or html file, you will have to restart gulp if you want gulp/BrowserSync to properly watch your new file for changes.
